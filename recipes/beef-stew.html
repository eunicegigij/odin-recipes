    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        If you come across African tomato sauce or Nigerian tomato stew you may be thinking it's 
        basically tomatoes in the stew. But it's not. Some people use only tomatoes to make this 
        recipe but I actually prefer a combination of tomatoes and bell peppers as I find it tastes 
        much better than the former.
    </p>
    <p>A stew with only tomatoes may taste more sour and acidic than a mix of tomatoes and bell peppers.</p>
