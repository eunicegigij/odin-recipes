        Nigerian jollof rice recipe! This African dish is packed full of flavor, rich, grainy,

    <p>
        Jollof is smoky and spicy, with a hint of sweetness from the tomatoes. 
        Thanks to the herbs and seasonings, it really does have multiple layers of flavor. 
         exact ingredients vary: Some people use seasoning cubes like Maggi or Knorr, while others 
         omit bell peppers and use only tomatoes. This recipe reflects the jollof rice I grew up eating, 
         which includes a lot of commonly used components like tomatoes, thyme, ginger, curry, 
        pepper, and garlic.
